# Cats and Dogs Classification Using Keras
## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple image classification task using the Keras deep learning library. The goal is to create a model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for training and testing consists of labeled images of cats and dogs.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (3.6 or higher)
TensorFlow (2.x)
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)
You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is not included in the repository due to its size. You can download the dataset from Kaggle's Dogs vs. Cats competition. After downloading, extract the contents and organize the files into the data directory in the following structure:

    |   |-- cat.0.jpg
    |   |-- cat.1.jpg
    |   |-- ...
    |   |-- dog.0.jpg
    |   |-- dog.1.jpg
    |   |-- ...
    |-- test/
    |   |-- 1.jpg
    |   |-- 2.jpg
    |   |-- ...
    |-- validation/
    |   |-- cat.0.jpg
    |   |-- cat.1.jpg
    |   |-- ...
    |   |-- dog.0.jpg
    |   |-- dog.1.jpg
    |   |-- ...

## Usage
Data Preprocessing: Run the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to prepare the dataset for training.

Training the Model: Execute the train_model.ipynb notebook to train the image classification model. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

Evaluation: After training, use the evaluate_model.ipynb notebook to evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.

Prediction: If you want to make predictions on new images, use the predict.ipynb notebook.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project is a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following layers:

Convolutional layer
Max pooling layer
Convolutional layer
Max pooling layer
Flatten layer
Dense layer
Output layer
You can find the details of the architecture in the model.py file.

## Results
The model achieves a certain accuracy on the validation set after training. The performance metrics and visualizations are available in the evaluate_model.ipynb notebook.
